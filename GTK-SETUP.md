# Notes on GTK

GTK has a bad setup for Windows Environment.

This tutorial should assume you know the basics of using MSYS2 to install GCC, GDB and G++ packages.
GTK setup is require too.

# Setup .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json

You need to specify the following into .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json

```
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Win32",
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}\\**",
                "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\include\\**",
                "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\lib\\**",
                "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\lib\\glib-2.0\\include",
                "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\lib\\graphene-1.0\\include"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```
# .vscode/tasks.json

Next, you need to specify the following into .vscode/tasks.json

```
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "cppbuild",
